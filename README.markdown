## HipChat plugin for Jenkins

This repo started as a fork from [jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin](https://github.com/jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin), although it seems many pull requests to that repo have gone un-considered.

The main difference between this code base and that is that I have added support for @mentions in the projects and that more details are added to build conclusion messages.
